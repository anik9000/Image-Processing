====================================================
Part 1: Histogram Modification
====================================================
I investigated the effect of an inverse gamma correction point operation given by the equation on a perfectly normal image. The above point operation would produce an image which has to be gamma corrected to restore its original contrast.
I included the original image and the pre-gamma corrected image in my report.
====================================================
Part 2: Image Histogram
====================================================
Given an image and a number of intensity bins, I computed its histogram. I have Written the histogram values to a file and plot it.
Run the code on the original image (lena) I used above for bins = 2, 128, and 256. Also run the code on the pre-gamma corrected image which I produced above for bins 2, 128, and 256.
=====================================================
Part 3: How Histogram Equalization Improves Contrast
=====================================================
Code to achieve histogram equalization. Use 256 bins. 
Included copies of the original and equalized histograms in this report as well as the original and equalized images.
